# Pinsky Lab Data Management Plan

The Pinsky Lab is an open science lab that believes in reproducible science.  To that aim:
1. Please keep data in the github repository related to the project.  It is best practice for this to be in a folder called "data" within the repository.  If you clean the data, you might want a folder called something like "data-raw" and a folder called "data-clean" to differentiate data in its original form from data that has been manipulated.
1. If your data is too large to store on github, please store it on the lab server.
1. Collaborative documents should be written in google drive.  We upload and share presentations on google drive so that other lab members can easily access useful graphics.
1. Write papers and manuscripts with the design and intent to publish a repository of the work upon publication.  
1. When matriculating, make sure all projects, code, papers, data, etc. have been migrated into the Pinsky Lab organization on GitHub.
