## Information for Prospective Undergraduate Students

"Research lab experience as an undergraduate is an important part of your education in deciding what you enjoy, what you do not enjoy, and to better understand what you could enjoy. To give you an idea of what goes on in our lab, common techniques used include PCR, DNA sequencing, and bioinformatics (data mining). The intent of these opportunities is to provide undergraduate students with hands on experience addressing various aquaculture and conservation issues using advanced molecular techniques. There are several options for receiving credit, including internship (Fish 498), independent research (Fish 499) and Capstone (Fish 494 and 495.) For more info about these options and the forms, please see the [SAFS Undergraduate Independent Study website](http://www.fish.washington.edu/undergraduates/independent.html). Normally, I will take up to 2 undergraduate students at any given time, so please contact me early if you are interested." - @sr320

Before committing to joining the MPG, look over our github repo and familiarize yourself with how we work. You'll notice several themes:

1. You will be expected to show up with some regularity (e.g. lab meetings, seminars, etc).
2. We do open science. So will you.
3. While projects are often driven independently, we foster a collaborative, inclusive team environment. Work together adn when in doubt, ask those around you.
