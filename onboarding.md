There are a few items to take care of now that you have joined the lab.

To Do List
----------

1.  Join the [MPG Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pinsky-lab) mailing list, Slack, and google calendar.
2.  Connect to the [MPG Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive).
    -   Click the "Shared with Me" link on the left.
    -   Right click on the MPG folder and select Add to My Drive. This will not affect the amount of storage available in your google drive.
3.  Read the [Lab Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSBKYZVmIAtyDjc7QiEbggeiVJmUmFw3P8Tf0HAB_VZuYMSzAQAR3CphP2bfrHWohW2oCDkDPFM7_oD/pub).
4.  Read the [Lab Data Management Policy](https://github.com/pinskylab/policies/blob/master/data-management.md).
5.  Write an [Independent Development Plan](https://myidp.sciencecareers.org)and share it with Malin.
6.  Download and begin to maintain a reference manager. We recommend Zotero, as the free software interfaces well with both Microsoft Word and Google Docs. Download Zotero and browser plugin [here](https://www.zotero.org/download/).  
7.  When you are ready, sign up for a lab meeting this summer.  The easiest way to find the schedule for lab meetings is to search Slack for "lab meeting" and the linked google file should pop up.

Computing Resources
-------------------

There are several computing resources available to serve your research computing needs.

| owner             | name       | number of cores | memory |
|-------------------|------------|-----------------|--------|
| Pinsky Lab        | amphiprion | 40              | 252G   |
| SEBS              | annotate   | 72              | 500G   |
| OARC-Pinsky node  | amarel     | 32              | 128G   |
| OARC-Ecology node | amarel     | 28              | 128G   |
| OARC              | amarel     | ?               | ?      |
| RDII              | caliburn   | 256             | 768G   |

*Various lab members have differing levels of experience with each of these servers and can help you figure out what is best for your analysis.*
**Amarel** is a condo system. You only have to wait in line with other Pinsky Lab folks for the Pinsky node, you have to wait in line with other Ecology folks for the DEENR node, you have to wait in line with all of Rutgers folks for the other nodes.
**Caliburn** is a proposal system. Only people who have submitted proposals and been approved have access to the resources. At the time of this document creation, the Pinsky Lab had access.

Guides and tutorials

#### Lab Calendar
As indicated in the contract, you will need to maintain your schedule on the [lab calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=bXJjMzA1QGdtYWlsLmNvbQ). A common mistake of newbies is they will make a calendar entry but it will be in the personal calendar and not the the lab calendar (thus we cannot see).

#### Lab Wiki
You need to maintain a lab notebook at <http://genefish.wordpress.com>. Contact Steven to be added as a lab member. You should become familiar with material on the [RobertsLab/resources wiki](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/wiki) to see what resources are available and what [other people are doing in the lab](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/wiki/Lab-Notebooks).

#### Guidelines for notebook entries
On a _daily basis_ you will need to document your research activities. This might just be an observation or reflection on what you experienced that day or a more detailed  plan of work and description of results. Entries need to be organized by date and in reverse chronological order. Here is a guideline to [Notebook Best Practices](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/wiki/Lab-Notebook-Best-Practices).

_Archiving data_
In many instances you will be generating new data, taking photos, or there will be some other file type that you will need to include in your notebook. While Wordpress.com does have the ability to host files, you need to maintain data on the network attached storage device known as eagle. There are a couple of means to upload data to Owl. The most straight forward means is to navigate to <http://owl.fish.washington.edu/>, click on `login`, enter in the given username and password. Navigate to >File Station > web > scaphopoda. Create a folder in scaphopoda and upload your content in this folder. Then you can go to <http://owl.fish.washington.edu/scaphapoda/> and view any file. Within in the wiki you can embed files using the given url of a file on Owl.

_Please refrain from using any non alpha-numeric (including spaces) in file and folder names._

#### Safety Protocols & Laboratory Tour
During your first week in the lab Sam White will provide you with a detail tour of the lab to make sure you are familar with layout and safety protocols. Please complete the [Roberts Lab Safety Training](https://github.com/RobertsLab/onboarding/wiki/Lab-Safety) and provide completed forms to Sam.

---
#### Slack
Our means of general communication in the lab is through a private [Slack team](genefish.slack.com). This is in lieu of email, providing a simple means of archiving, searching, and easy user management.

#### Lab Meetings
Lab Meetings are held in FTR230 on a weekly basis and are indicated on the Lab Calendar. The day-of-week and time-of-day is subject to change, so please check the calendar each week. You can catch up on meetings you missed or older meetings by listening to [archived audio recordings](http://genefish.wikispaces.com/Lab+Meetings).
